   - Click "Generate new token" > "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Select scopes: `repo` (all checkboxes under repo)
   - Click "Generate token"
   - **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)

3. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   - Username: `fullstackaiautomation` (or your GitHub username)
   - Password: Paste your Personal Access Token (not your GitHub password!)

   ```

- Check that the token has `repo` permissions

**If the repository doesn't exist:**
- Create it first at https://github.com/new
- Name it: `fullstackwebsite`
- Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

**If you want me to help:**
- Just let me know which method you want to use!
- I can guide you through any of the options above
